1.4.2 Stupid Architectural Simulator Explanation

This program gets two random values from memory and add them.
Then by calling the rand() function we load the random values
from memory and put them inside the array of chars DM[] and 
then we store the values in char Reg1 and Reg2 and Reg3.
By calling the Add function, we add 2 chars into 1, which is the destination.
IP will be set to 1 always.
Z will be false always (Z=0)
