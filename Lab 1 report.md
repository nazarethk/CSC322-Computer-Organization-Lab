Lab 1: Report
=============
During lab 1, we started learning the basic concepts of C. 
Then we started writing code on Ubuntu Terminal.
We studied how to use terminal commands and which one to use
to compile and to put Command line arguments for the C program.
We used the atoi function, that converts a string into an integer numerical representation.
The last program we wrote in the lab, was a char to integer converter,
which takes 2 inputs or even number of inputs, and converts them into integer.
