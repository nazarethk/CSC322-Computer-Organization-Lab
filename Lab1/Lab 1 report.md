
Lab 1: Report
=============
1 Introduction:
===============
During lab 1, we started learning the basic concepts of C.

2 Discussion:
=============
We started writing code on Ubuntu Terminal.
We studied how to use terminal commands and which one to use, to compile and to put Command line arguments for the C program.
We used the atoi function, that converts a string into an integer numerical representation.
The last program we wrote in the lab, was a char to integer converter,
which takes 2 inputs or even number of inputs, and converts them into integer.

3 Results Analysis:
===================
After testing the code, we noticed that the program needs at least 2 arguments. The number of arguments should be even.
After compiling and running the code, the program outputs the arguments with respective order.

4 Conclusion:
=============
After the lab 1, we studied the basics of the C language. We studied also how to compile a c file using commands from the terminal "gcc -o name filename.c"...
